# frog-network
Neural networking with frogs. Frogs gain points by collecting food and (optionally) lose points by jumping. Each generation, a roullette wheel choice determinded by points is used to repopulate and crossbreed. Three inputs are fed into a six neuron hidden layer, which in turn is used to generate the four outputs. Mutations happen at a rate of 5%.
